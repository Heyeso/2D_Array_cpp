Measuring the efficiency of Copying functionality:
Copy 1000000 members took 140 clock ticks (0.14 seconds)!
Copy 4000000 members took 18 clock ticks (0.018 seconds)!
Copy 16000000 members took 92 clock ticks (0.092 seconds)!
Copy 64000000 members took 248 clock ticks (0.248 seconds)!
Copy 256000000 members took 973 clock ticks (0.973 seconds)!
-Time increases, in average, by a factor of 2.37174 compared to the scaling factor 4
